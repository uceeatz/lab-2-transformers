        "While an in-depth understanding of the Transformer architecture is not necessary to complete the tasks in this lab, it is useful to have an understanding of the core concepts that make Tranformer models the state-of-the-art in ML and NLP:\n",

        "**Positional encoding** is a technique used in the Transformer architecture to give the model an understanding of the position of the elements in the input sequence, while allowing them to be processed in parallel. It's implemented by adding a learned vector to the input embedding at each position of the input sequence, which encodes the position information of the element in the input sequence.\n",

        "**Attention** is a mechanism that allows a model to weigh the importance of different elements of the input when processing it. Attention mechanisms calculate a set of attention weights that indicate how much each element of the input should be considered when computing the final output.\n",

        "**Self-attention** is a specific type of attention mechanism used in the encoder of Transformer models to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence. For NLP, this allows words to be understood in the context of phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc.\n",

        "**Multi-head self-attention** is an extension of the single-head self-attention mechanism, where the model computes multiple sets of attention weights, each using a different set of learned parameters. It helps the model capture more complex relationships between the input elements. Multi-head self-attention is used in the encoder of Transformer models.\n",
